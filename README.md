## Cancer Data Aggregator Data Model


### Cancer Data Aggregator
The Cancer Data Aggregator (CDA) is a query engine to aggregate data across the  [National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC)](https://datascience.cancer.gov/data-commons). CDA will facilitate interoperability within the larger data ecosystem by connecting to additional data repositories.

CDA will enable cancer researchers to discover, query, retrieve, and aggregate data by developing a single, interoperable, read-only API that can be used to query across disparate data types and data repositories.

### Related Efforts
The [Center for Cancer Data Harmonization (CCDH)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/center-cancer-data-harmonization) will facilitate harmonization across CRDC nodes and data coordinating centers by creating a harmonized data model (CRDC-H) as well as vocabulary services and other tools.

### CDA Data Model
To enable the CDA and the CRDC-H to advance quickly, CDA maintains a data model that meets phased CDA requirements while aligning as closely as possible to released CRDC-H iterations.
